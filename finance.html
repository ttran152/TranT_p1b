                <br>
            <h5><b>a) We believe the factors that will influence our ability to achieve our objectives include:</b></h5>
            <ul>
                <li>our prospective customers’ willingness to migrate to enterprise cloud computing services</li>
                <li>our ability to maintain a balanced portfolio of products and customers</li>
                <li>the availability, performance and security of our service</li>
                <li>our ability to continue to release, and gain customer acceptance of, new and improved features</li>
                <li>our ability to successfully integrate acquired businesses and technologies</li>
                <li>successful customer adoption and utilization of our service</li>
                <li>our ability to continue to meet new and evolving privacy laws and regulations, acceptance of our
                    service
                    in markets where we have few customers</li>
                <li>the emergence of additional competitors in our market and improved product offerings by existing and
                    new
                    competitors</li>
                <li>the location of new data centers that we operate as well as the new locations of services provided
                    by
                    third-party cloud computing platform provider</li>
                <li>third-party developers’ willingness to develop applications on our platforms</li>
                <li>our ability to attract new personnel and retain and motivate current personnel</li>
                <li>general economic conditions which could affect our customers’ ability and willingness to purchase
                    our
                    services, delay the customers’ purchasing decision or affect attrition rates</li>
            </ul>
            To address these factors, we will need to, among other things, continue to add substantial numbers of paying
            subscriptions, upgrade our customers to fully featured versions or arrangements such as an Enterprise
            License
            Agreement, provide high quality technical support to our customers, encourage the development of third-party
            applications on our platforms, realize the benefits from our strategic partnerships and continue to focus on
            retaining customers at the time of renewal.</p>

            <p><b>We drive innovation organically and to a lesser extent through acquisitions,</b> such as our
                acquisition of
                MuleSoft and in August 2018 our acquisition of Datorama, Inc. (“Datorama”). We have a disciplined and
                thoughtful acquisition process where we routinely survey the industry landscape across a wide range of
                companies. As a result of our aggressive growth plans and integration of our previously acquired
                businesses, we have incurred significant expenses from equity awards and amortization of purchased
                intangibles, which have reduced our operating income. We remain focused on improving operating margins.

            <p><b>Our typical subscription contract term is 12 to 36 months,</b> although terms range from one to 60
                months, so during any fiscal reporting period only a subset of active subscription contracts is eligible
                for renewal. We calculate our attrition rate as of the end of each month. Our attrition rate, including
                the Marketing Cloud service offering but excluding our Commerce Cloud service offering and integration
                service offering, was less than ten percent as of January 31, 2019. While it is difficult to predict, we
                expect our attrition rate to remain consistent as we continue to expand our enterprise business and

    <!-- SOURCE OF REVENUE -->
    <section class="revenue container">
        <h4>2. Sources of revenue</h4>
        <h5><b>We derive our revenues from two sources:</b></h5>
        <div class="revenue-info flex">
            <p>
                Subscription revenues, which are comprised of subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise
                cloud computing services (collectively, “Cloud Services”), software licenses, and from customers paying
                for additional support beyond the standard support that is included in the basic subscription fees.
                Subscription revenues are driven primarily by the number of paying subscribers, varying service types,
                and the price of our service and renewals. We define a “customer” as a separate and distinct buying
                entity (e.g., a company, a distinct business unit of a large corporation, a partnership, etc.) that has
                entered into a contract to access our enterprise cloud computing services.
                <br>
                <br>
                Related professional services such as process mapping, project management, implementation services and
                other revenue. “Other revenue” consists primarily of training fees. Subscription and support revenues
                accounted for approximately 93 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2019.
            </p>
            <img src="images/group-study.png" />
        </div>
        <p>
            Subscription and support revenues for Cloud Services are recognized ratably over the
            contract terms
            beginning on the commencement dates of each contract. Subscription revenues for software licenses are
            generally recognized upfront when the software is made available to the customer. The typical
            subscription and support term is 12 to 36 months, although terms range from one to 60 months. Our
            subscription and support contracts are non-cancelable, though customers typically have the right to
            terminate their contracts for cause if we materially fail to perform.
        </p>
        <div class="revenue-info flex">
            <p>We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide
                that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in
                accounts receivable and in unearned revenue, or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to
                customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service
                period.
                <br>
                <br>
                Professional services and other revenues consist of fees associated with consulting and implementation
                services and training. Our consulting and implementation engagements are billed on a time and materials,
                fixed fee or subscription basis. We also offer a number of training classes on implementing, using and
                administering our service that are billed on a per person, per class basis. Our typical professional
                services payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice.

                As we acquire new businesses and technologies, the amortization expense associated with the purchase of
                acquired developed technology will be included in cost of revenues. Additionally, as we enter into new
                contracts with third parties for the use of their technology, services or data, or as our sales volume
                grows, the fees paid to use such technology or services may increase. Finally, we expect the cost of
                professional services to be approximately in line with revenues from professional services as we believe
                this investment in professional services facilitates the adoption of our service offerings. </p>
