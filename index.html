                <h3>Fellow shareholders,</h3>
                <p>As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of Salesforce, we couldn’t be more excited
                    about the future. In everything we do, we remain committed to our core values —
                    trust, customer success, innovation, and equality. Around the world, companies
                    continue to make incredible investments in their customer experience — becoming
                    more customer-centric, more efficient, and more automated. And when they
                    invest in their digital transformation, they look to Salesforce, the global CRM
                    leader and one of the world’s most admired companies.
                    <br>
                    <br>By upholding the trust of our customers and by focusing relentlessly on their
                    success, Salesforce delivered another record fiscal year in 2019, surpassing $13
                    billion in annual revenue and reaching this milestone faster than any enterprise
                    software company in history. With this strong growth, we’re now on track to
                    organically double our revenue in the next four years, with a new revenue target
                    of $26 to $28 billion in FY23.
                    <br>
                    <br>
            </div>
            <img class="headqtr-1999" src="images/headqtr-1999.jpg" alt="Salesforce Headquarter 1999" />
        </div>
        <p>This year, we continued to deepen our strategic relationships with companies of
            every size and across every industry around the world. In fact, our $20 million-plus
            relationships grew 48% over last year. We also strengthened our partnerships
            with Google and AWS and formed a brand-new partnership with Apple to deliver
            even more value to our customers. With our integrated and intelligent Salesforce
            Customer Success Platform, no other CRM company gives businesses a unified
            view of their customers across every touchpoint — sales, service, marketing,
            commerce, communities, integration, and more.
            <br>
            <br>At Dreamforce 2018 — our largest Dreamforce yet — we showcased how our
            amazing innovations like Einstein Voice, Customer 360, and Essentials will continue
            to transform the CRM experience for companies around the world. And with
            Trailhead, our free online learning platform for everyone, more than 1.2 million
            people have now learned the skills they need to thrive in our digital economy.
            <br>

            <br>
            We also continue to uphold the trust of the communities where we work and live.
            Over the past 20 years, together with the Salesforce Foundation and Salesforce.org,
            we’ve given $260 million in grants, nearly 4 million employee volunteer hours,
            and 40,000 nonprofits and education institutions use our software for free or at
            a discount. We’re partnering with other companies to decarbonize the tech sector,
            and at Salesforce we’re already more than halfway toward our goal of reaching
            100% renewable energy by 2022.
            <br>
            <br>
            Once again, our success has been recognized. Fortune has now named Salesforce
            one of the “World’s Best Companies to Work For” for 11 years in a row, one of
            the “World’s Most Admired Companies” for five years in a row, and one of the
            “Change the World Companies” for three years in a row.
            <br>
            <br>
            As always, our incredible results are only possible because of the trust and
            partnership with all of our stakeholders, including you. Thank you for your
            continued support. We are deeply grateful to each of you, and as we look ahead
            to our third decade, we’ve never been more optimistic about our future together.

            <h3>Our History</h3>

                companies
                to improve their relationships and interactions with customers. Founded in 1999, Salesforce empowers
                companies of every size and industry to connect with their customers in new ways through existing and
                emerging technologies, including cloud, mobile, social, Internet of Things (“IoT”) and artificial
                intelligence (“AI”), to grow their business and work more productively.</p>

            <p>The Salesforce Customer Success Platform delivers services spanning sales, service, marketing, commerce,
                engagement, integration, analytics, industries, communities, enablement and collaboration, most of which
                operate on a single trusted cloud platform. Our service offerings are designed to be intuitive and easy
                to
                use. They can be deployed quickly via mobile devices and major internet browsers, configured easily, and
                integrated with other platforms and enterprise applications. We sell to businesses worldwide primarily
                on a
                subscription basis, through our direct sales efforts and also indirectly through partners. Through our
                platform and other developer tools, we also enable third parties to develop additional functionality and
                new
                applications, or apps, that run on our platform, which are sold separately from—or in conjunction
                with—our
                service offerings.
                <br>
                <br>
                Salesforce operates based on a core set of values: trust, customer success, innovation and equality.
                Foremost among these is trust, which is the foundation for everything we do. Our customers trust our
                technology to deliver the highest levels of security, reliability, and availability at scale. We believe
                our
                continuous innovation and the democratization of both technology and innovation drives customer success,
                which in turn drives mutual growth. In addition, we have spearheaded initiatives that foster a culture
                of
                equal pay, equal advancement, equal opportunity and equal rights for our more than 35,000 employees as a
                leading example for the broader world.
